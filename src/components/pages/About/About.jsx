      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Stephen Mov, a passionate and dynamic professional with a
        diverse background in restaurant management and an exciting new journey
        as a full stack developer.<br></br>
        <br></br>
        For the past 10 years, I have thrived in the fast-paced and
        customer-centric environment of the restaurant industry. As a restaurant
        manager, I honed my skills in leadership, team building, and
        problem-solving, ensuring seamless operations and delivering exceptional
        dining experiences for our guests.<br></br>
        <br></br>
        However, my insatiable curiosity and fascination with technology have
        led me to embark on a thrilling career transition into the world of full
        stack development. I believe that like running a successful restaurant,
        building robust and user-friendly web applications requires a perfect
        blend of creativity, efficiency, and attention to detail.<br></br>
        <br></br>
        My programming journey began with self-guided learning and online
        courses, where I gained proficiency in languages such as HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, and React. These skills ignited my passion for software
        development, and I have since delved into various frameworks and
        libraries, including React, Node.js, and Django. The process of creating
        intuitive interfaces and bringing ideas to life through code has been
        incredibly fulfilling, and I am eager to continue exploring new
        technologies and evolving as a developer.<br></br>
        <br></br>
        As a former restaurant manager, I bring a unique perspective to software
        development. I excel at collaborating with diverse teams, managing
        multiple projects simultaneously, and maintaining a strong commitment to
        delivering results on time. My experience in customer service has
        instilled in me a customer-centric approach to development, ensuring
        that the end-users' needs are at the forefront of every project I work
        on. <br></br>
        <br></br>
        In my free time, you can often find me experimenting with new coding
        challenges, contributing to open-source projects, or seeking inspiration
        in the culinary world to bring innovative ideas into both code and
        cuisine. <br></br>
        <br></br>I am thrilled about the prospect of combining my past
        experience and my newfound passion for full stack development to create
        impactful and delightful digital experiences. I am actively seeking
        opportunities to contribute my skills and expertise to a
        forward-thinking team where I can make a meaningful difference.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. If you
        would like to connect or discuss potential collaborations, I would love
        to hear from you. Let's build something extraordinary together!
